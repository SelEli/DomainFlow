# DomainFlow
DomainFlow is a lightweight domain modeling engine designed to:

- describe a domain using simple JSON files  
- validate and compile domain structures  
- generate hierarchical visual layouts  
- support multiple renderers (tree, graph, hierarchy, etc.)  
- serve as a foundation for backend or system architecture  

DomainFlow is renderer-agnostic.  
A hierarchical renderer is included as an example, and additional renderers can be added easily.

This project is under active development.
